# Crystal Mine

## Setup

user
   x read:user
   x user:email
```
* Save your GitHub username and the token it in a file called `config.txt` like this:

USERNAME:TOKEN
```

* TODO:
* 
* Create a cross reference with the authors
* Create a page with the pictures of the authors
* Collect all the contributors as well and show them as well
* Allow people to ask to be excluded (a config file in the mine or in their own GitHub repo?)
